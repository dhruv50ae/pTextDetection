# Python Text Detection

- Clean, minimal, and simple computer vision application used for reading basic characters and displaying them above.

## Description

- Used both CV2 and Python logic 
- The for loop iterates through every word or character in an array 
- The array is updated by OpenCV 
- Makes use of pytesseract 
- I intentially left the errors in the image, this is to demonstrate that OpenCV can have trouble reading text. The solution to make it more readable is to grayscale the image then taking that image, making it more blurry. 

## What I learnt

- CV2 Methods ✅
- Debugging using StackOverflow, Google, and Youtube ✅
- Pytesseract ✅
- Real use of OpenCV2 ✅
- Drawring on images ✅
- What makes images more or less readable ✅
- Why images can be more or less readable ✅
- Reading clear text ✅
## How To Use

- Add an image to the Photos directory and change the value of the image name in the main.py file. 
- This should output a photo with text above each value in the array
